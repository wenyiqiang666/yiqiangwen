#   About me
Hello, everyoneÔºÅMy name is Yiqiang Wen. Currently, I‚Äôm doing research as an undergraduate researcher at University of Toronto in [the Mott Lab](http://www.themottlab.com/). My research pursuits primarily revolve around the realms of cellular and molecular biology, with a keen focus on elucidating the signaling pathways within the cell system. 

My scholarly endeavors are fundamentally motivated by a profound aspiration to venture into the frontier of scientific research. I am driven by an insatiable curiosity to unravel the systematic underpinnings of life itself, a pursuit that I find profoundly meaningful and captivating.
